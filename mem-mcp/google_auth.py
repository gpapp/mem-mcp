"""Google sign-in for the browser: the OAuth 2.0 authorization-code flow.

This module used to verify a Google **ID token** that a person pasted into the
Setup page, which meant it needed a JWT library, a JWKS cache, an audience
check, an algorithm pin and a clock-skew window -- about 270 lines to answer the
question "is this string really from Google?". All of that exists to support a
flow nobody asked for.

The ordinary flow is three HTTP calls and no cryptography at all:

    1. send the browser to Google's consent screen with a `state` we minted;
    2. Google sends it back to our callback URL with a short-lived `code`;
    3. we trade that code plus our client secret for an access token, and read
       the signed-in user from Google's userinfo endpoint.

Because the code is redeemed with the **client secret** over TLS, and the
userinfo response arrives over TLS from Google, the confidentiality and
authenticity the signature check used to provide are provided by the transport
and by the secret. That is how every web app that signs people in with Google
works; the local verification is what a *resource server* does when it has no
secret to present and therefore cannot make a back-channel call.

The trade, stated plainly: a leaked client secret is now a real credential
someone could use, where before only the client id was involved. That is the
normal trade for a confidential client, and it is why the secret lives in the
environment (an operator's secret) rather than in a file the app writes.

Deliberately stdlib-only. `urllib` is entirely adequate for two form posts and a
GET, and keeping the module importable with nothing but the standard library is
what lets `test_google_auth.py` import and *call* it on a machine with no web
framework, no network and no JWT library -- the same reason `sessions.py` and
`matching_utils.py` are stdlib-only.

The one seam is `opener`, an injected `urllib.request.OpenerDirector`-alike.
Everything above it is pure: URL building, parameter validation, and the shape
of the answers. That is the entire attack surface of an OAuth client, so that is
what the tests exercise.
